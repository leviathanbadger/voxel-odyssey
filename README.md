# Voxel Odyssey: A Real-Time Collaborative Voxel Canvas

## Note for Humans

This project is partially an experiment to see what OpenAI's Codex can do when given minimal instructions.
The README (and most all of the code) is generated by Codex, and I'm not sure how much of it will be technically correct.

## Project Summary

Voxel Odyssey is an ambitious, browser-based 3D voxel canvas that allows multiple users to collaboratively build and explore voxel art and worlds in real time. Leveraging cutting-edge web technologies like **WebGPU** (which became stable in major browsers in mid-2023), **WebRTC**, and **WebAssembly**, it brings high-performance graphics and peer-to-peer networking directly to the web without plugins.

## Goals

- **Real-Time Interaction**: Low-latency updates so multiple users can see each other's changes instantly.
- **High-Performance Rendering**: Efficient 3D rendering of voxel data using WebGPU.
- **Peer-to-Peer Networking**: Direct browser-to-browser communication via WebRTC for decentralized synchronization.
- **Extensibility**: Modular architecture enabling easy addition of new tools, physics, or game modes.

## Tech Stack

| Layer            | Technology            |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| Rendering        | WebGPU                |
| Compute / Logic  | WebAssembly (Rust)    |
| Networking       | WebRTC DataChannels   |
| UI / Controls    | TypeScript + React    |
| Build / Tooling  | Vite                  |
| Deployment       | Netlify / GitHub Pages|

## Project Plan

### Milestone 1: Prototype Core Rendering (Weeks 1–2)

- Setup project scaffolding with Vite and TypeScript.
- Integrate WebGPU context and render a basic 3D grid of voxels.
- Implement camera controls (orbit, pan, zoom).
- **Deliverable**: Static scene rendering a 16³ voxel volume.

### Milestone 2: Voxel Editing Tools (Weeks 3–4)

- Add basic editing tools: add/remove voxels, color picker.
- Build UI for tool selection and color palette.
- Optimize voxel data structures for real-time edits.
- **Deliverable**: Single-user interactive voxel editor.

### Milestone 3: Networking & Sync (Weeks 5–7)

- Integrate WebRTC DataChannels for peer-to-peer connectivity.
- Design synchronization protocol for voxel diffs and state reconciliation.
- Implement session discovery/signaling server (simple Node.js + WebSocket).
- **Deliverable**: Two users can jointly edit the same voxel canvas.

### Milestone 4: Persistence & Hosting (Weeks 8–9)

- Add data persistence via backend API (e.g., serverless function + database).
- Build project save/load functionality.
- Configure CI/CD pipeline and deploy to Netlify or GitHub Pages + serverless backend.
- **Deliverable**: Publicly deployable demo with save/load sessions.

### Milestone 5: Advanced Features & Polish (Weeks 10–12)

- Implement undo/redo and version history.
- Add physics sandbox mode (e.g., falling blocks, simple collision).
- Mobile touch controls and UI improvements.
- Hook up analytics and performance monitoring.
- **Deliverable**: Production-ready release v1.0.

## Roadmap & Future Ideas

- **Plugin System**: Support custom shaders, behaviors, and game modes.
- **VR/AR Mode**: Integrate WebXR to experience creations in immersive environments.
- **Scaling**: Shard large canvases and support hundreds of concurrent users.
- **Social Features**: Chat, voice, and community galleries.
